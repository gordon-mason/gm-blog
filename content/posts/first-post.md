My name is Gordon. I'm a software engineer from Scotland. 

This blog is an exercise to sharpen my writing and document some of the things I've learned in my career. I'll avoid using AI and declare explicitly if I do so.

Since 2017 I've gained experience building SPAs, APIs/microservices, data pipelines, data lakes, and event-driven applications across finance, consulting and SaaS businesses.

One thing I've learned: It's important not to over-engineer solutions (Keep It Simple, Stupid). We want something that's straight forward and flexible enough for future requirements.  

I've opted to use Hugo static site generator for this blog, deployed with Netlify. The GitHub integration made it simple to get a site running within minutes.
